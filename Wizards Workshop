wizards workshop notes

Concept
	This is a personalized workshop intended to help programmers work on projects, keep notes organized, and develop tools for future use.

	Develop files, links, programs, tools, resource, databases.

	Palleton
	Password Generator
	Links to websites
	Keyboard Shortcuts
	Youtube vidoes
	Notes
	Graphic displays
	All the tools I had on my personal website
	dice/ randomizer
	Make it a dual portfolio/workstation of sorts

	How will this work? I'm going to start it with Laravel, use git as a vcs. Update nearly every day. I might fold it into HaynieHaven at some point. I'll keep it updating as I find more stuff that I want to add to it. Maybe someday it will be my Portfolio. Maybe a guest/ user interface.

	Any themes?
